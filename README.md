# Whosaved2
The remastered project of Whosaved based on [ImpactJS](https://impactjs.com/)

## Requirements :warning:

### Software installation 
You need a running server based on PHP7 and Apache2. An extension with a database management is in preview.

I recommend using [Wamp](https://www.wampserver.com/)

You can also check the [Impact installation page](https://impactjs.com/documentation/getting-started) for more details

### Basic knowledge of Javascript 
In order to make it work, we need a decent mastery in Javascript and object programming knowledge as we are going to use only Objects with Impact JS

##  Workflow 
To contribute to the project, feel free to submit merge requests, don't forget to specify what the code does and how to test
