# Whosaved2
The remastered project of Whosaved based on [ImpactJS](https://impactjs.com/)

Check the original project [here](https://github.com/MaximePie/Whosaved). 

:warning: The projet does not work anymore on C as we tried to restore it unsuccessfuly. But you can still check the images resources. 

## Requirements :warning:

### Software installation 
You need a running server based on PHP7 and Apache2. An extension with a database management is in preview.

I recommend using [Wamp](https://www.wampserver.com/)

You can also check the [Impact installation page](https://impactjs.com/documentation/getting-started) for more details

### Basic knowledge of Javascript 
In order to make it work, we need a decent mastery in Javascript and object programming knowledge as we are going to use only Objects with Impact JS

##  Workflow 
To contribute to the project, feel free to submit merge requests, don't forget to specify what the code does and how to test

## Getting started with the projet 

First make sure Impact is well installed and configured by checking [this Impact installation guide](https://impactjs.com/documentation/getting-started)

Make sure that your server root points on the project folder. (If you need help, check [this](https://phantomthemes.com/how-to-change-the-www-root-directory-on-wampserver-3/))

Once Wamp is loaded, you can open up the project by visiting localhost/WhoSaved2

### Graphics
